# AutoCAD Lisps for Civil Engineering

Welcome to **AutoCAD Lisps 4 All**, a community-driven collection of helpful AutoCAD Lisp routines for civil engineering tasks! 🚧👷‍♂️👷‍♀️

Our goal is simple: to share, learn, and improve AutoCAD Lisp routines that make life easier for civil engineers. Whether you're designing roads, working with grading, or just looking to enhance your AutoCAD efficiency, you'll find something useful here. And if you have your own lisps to share, we'd love for you to contribute!

## 📂 What's in This Repository?

This repository contains a variety of Lisp routines to help with common tasks in civil engineering. Some examples include:
- Automating repetitive tasks
- Simplifying complex calculations
- Improving drawing precision and consistency
- Optimizing workflows

As this repository is a work in progress, we encourage you to browse, try out the tools, and share your feedback.

## 🚀 How to Use

1. Clone or download the repository to your computer.
2. Load the Lisp files into AutoCAD:
   - Type `AP` in the AutoCAD command line to open the "Load/Unload Applications" window.
   - Navigate to the folder where you saved the Lisp file(s).
   - Select the file and click "Load."
3. Follow the instructions in the specific Lisp file to use its features.

If you're new to Lisp or loading routines in AutoCAD, don't worry! Check out the **Getting Started** section below.
